My name is <span style=\"color: gold\">Jordan.</span> I'm an aspiring and self-taught developer, based in the UK, with an interest in backend engineering. \n\nI'm most comfortable with <span style=\"color:gold\">Python</span>, but have written some projects in <span style=\"color:gold\">Go & Javascript</span> as well (including this site!). You can check out some descriptions on the projects page, and see all the code on my Github!\n\nFront-end coding is quite new to me, so if you've found this page and have any suggestions, you can send me an email through the <span style=\"color:gold\">contact page</span>. Even if you'd just like to say hi, <span style=\"color:gold\">I'd love to hear from you</span>, so please feel free!\n\nWhen I'm not trying to learn some new code related thing, I enjoy watching <span style=\"color:gold\">Formula 1</span>, reading <span style=\"color:gold\">spooky novels</span>, and listening to podcasts like <span style=\"color:gold\">Darknet Diaries</span> and <span style=\"color:gold\">The Last Podcast On The Left</span>."
